# GLOBAL TERRORISM REPORT

## Overview

**Global Terrorism Analysis** is a comprehensive project developed during my internship with The Sparks Foundation. This work leverages the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**â€”an extensive open-source dataset chronicling terrorist incidents worldwide from 1970 through 2017.

The GTD is maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland and is currently the most extensive unclassified resource on terrorism, containing detailed information on more than 180,000 terrorist attacks.

## Introduction to the Dataset

The Global Terrorism Database offers systematic data on both domestic and international terrorist incidents, including:

- Over 180,000 documented terrorist attacks worldwide
- More than 88,000 bombings, 19,000 assassinations, and 11,000 kidnappings
- At least 45 detailed attributes per incident, with recent events encompassing over 120 variables
- Data collection based on over 4 million news articles and 25,000 news sources from 1998 to 2017 alone

This rich dataset is pivotal for researchers, policy makers, and security analysts aiming to understand patterns, trends, and impacts of terrorism globally.

## Project Goals

1. Conduct thorough research to understand the origins, scope, and nuances of the GTD dataset and its subject matter.
2. Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and quality for analysis.
3. Perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns in terrorism incidents.
4. Dive deeper into granular data analysis to extract actionable insights and contribute to the broader field of terrorism studies.
